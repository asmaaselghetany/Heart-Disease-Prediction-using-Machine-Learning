# Heart-Disease-Prediction-using-Machine-Learning
This project implements Machine Learning (ML) models to predict the likelihood of heart disease in patients based on medical attributes such as age, blood pressure, cholesterol levels, and other risk factors. Using Supervised Learning, we classify patients into heart disease risk categories.
