# Heart-Disease-Prediction-using-Machine-Learning
This project implements Machine Learning (ML) models to predict the likelihood of heart disease in patients based on medical attributes such as age, blood pressure, cholesterol levels, and other risk factors. Using Supervised Learning, we classify patients into heart disease risk categories.

Key Features
✅ Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to understand patterns in heart disease occurrence.
✅ Feature Engineering to improve model performance.
✅ Multiple ML Models: Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forest, SVM, and Neural Networks.
✅ Hyperparameter Tuning to optimize model accuracy.
✅ Model Evaluation using accuracy, precision, recall, and AUC-ROC curve.


Dataset
The dataset used in this project is the Cleveland Heart Disease dataset from the UCI Machine Learning Repository.
